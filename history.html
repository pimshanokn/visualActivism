  <h3 id="page2h3" class="headings">The History of Visual Activism</h3>

  <div class="text">
  <p>
    In <em>The Rhetoric of the Image</em> (1964), Roland Barthes states that
    “advertising prioritizes the directness of the image and its efficacy in
    transmitting the advertisement’s message” (<a href="https://hyperallergic.com/597846/the-evolution-of-instagram-activism/">
    "The Evolution of Instagram Activism"</a>). The first examples of graphic design are sourced to the
    Renaissance era with printer’s marks, small logos on the first mass-produced
    books. It was not until the mid-17th century that corantos, ancestors of
    newspapers, featured ads for products. In the 20th century, agencies that
    created logos and ads for companies were developed, as companies began to
    realize the power of visual communication.
  </p>

  <p>
    The application of graphic design to social activism can be traced to the
    work of W.E.B. Du Bois. At the 1900 World’s Fair, W.E.B. Du Bois and his
    team at Atlanta University created “data portraits” that used information
    from sociological research about Black Americans’ economic and social
    conditions. In fact, Du Bois can be credited for creating some of the first
    infographics; his work “employed a distinctly European visual vocabulary --
    one that drew on Florence Nightingale’s well-known infographics as well as
    proto-modernist design” (<a href="https://hyperallergic.com/597846/the-evolution-of-instagram-activism/">
    "The Evolution of Instagram Activism"</a>). Like the main purpose of
    infographics to make data and information accessible to the general public,
    Du Bois hoped his infographics would be readable for the black community.
  </p>

  <p>
    Political art has been an important means of subversion, a popular manner
    being “imitating popular visual styles” (<a href="https://hyperallergic.com/597846/the-evolution-of-instagram-activism/">
    "The Evolution of Instagram Activism"</a>). In <em>The Design of Dissent</em>
    (2004), Milton Glaser and Mirko Ilić discuss “subtle manipulation of logos
    and advertising campaigns, and not-so-subtle photoshop collages” (<a href="https://hyperallergic.com/597846/the-evolution-of-instagram-activism/">
    "The Evolution of Instagram Activism"</a>). The familiarity of these designs
    allow artists to spread their message to a wider audience.

    In <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1470412915619459">
    "Between Rebel Creativity and Reification: For and Against Visual Activism,"</a>
    TJ Demos dissects the visual activist work of three groups:
    Laboratory of Insurrectionary Imagination (Labofii), the Grupo de
    Investigación en Arte y Política (GIAP), and the photographer Subhanker
    Banerjee. Labofii aims “to celebrate ‘the beauty of collective creative
    disobedience’” and build “affinity groups rather than informing strangers of
    issues through visual language.” GIAP is a research collaboration that hopes
    to “investigate the aesthetics and politics of revolutionary movements,
    especially the Zapatistas’ long-standing, indigenous-led rural assertion of
    political, social, and environmental autonomy.” While Labofii’s and GIAP’s
    work emphasize the connectedness of visuality and activism, Subhanker
    Banerjee’s photography focuses on the ability of visual activism to
    challenge and influence the audience of galleries. Banerjee’s work draws
    attention to the Arctic conservation and indigenous human rights movements.
    Even though Banerjee’s work hopes to “generate political drive via museum
    exhibitions and internet-based systems of reproducibility and distribution,”
    all three examples refuse to contribute to the dominant art institutions
    that may be connected to “the right-wing agenda of corporate neoliberalism,
    wealth inequality, and the destruction of the social state.”

    The emergence of computers and computer applications of vector drawing and
    photographic processing since the 1980s facilitated the creation of
    infographics. In the 2010 documentary <a href="https://vimeo.com/14777910?utm_campaign=5370367&utm_source=affiliate&utm_channel=affiliate&cjevent=0ed627ca5a9911ec813500b40a82b839&clickid=0ed627ca5a9911ec813500b40a82b839">
    <em>Journalism in the Age of Data</em></a>, Jeffrey Heer predicted the
    growing importance of data visualization for the next decade. At the time
    the “amount of and access to data [was] exploding.” Data visualization is
    valued for putting data in context and allowing a larger audience to better
    understand complex data. Both artists and journalists are continuing to
    explore the capabilities of data visualization--how to effectively convey
    the narrative of a set of data to an audience. Back in 2010, bad visualization
    was a dangerous threat, for the audience had to make their own conclusions
    from a set of data, which had the possibility of error. That era also
    introduced a new trend of data visualization meeting motion graphics and
    narrative, such as with the work of <a href="https://vimeo.com/3261363">“The
    Crisis of Credit Visualized”</a> by Jonathan Jarvis (2009). Overall, data
    visualization was holding increasing importance in the world of journalism,
    with The New York Times at the forefront of interactive and sophisticated
    graphics and other companies like MSNBC and BBC News Online looking to
    incorporate more employees that can work on data-based journalism.

      With the increasing use of infographics with the spread of technology in the
      past decade, “infographics are being increasingly used for public advisories,
      disseminating protocols for healthcare professionals, and post-publication
      promotion of research,” which has been especially important during the
      COVID-19 pandemic (<a href="https://jkms.org/DOIx.php?id=10.3346/jkms.2021.36.e41">
      "Preparing Infographics for Post-publication Promotion of Research on
      Social Media"</a>). Healthcare professionals are expected to keep up with
      a large influx of new research findings, so infographics on social media
      help to relieve that with their effectiveness for providing fast
      dissemination. In addition, among the rise of fake news on social media,
      infographics provide credible public health information for the general public.
    </p>

    <p>
      In 2017, Instagram launched their 10-image carousel feature. Today it is being
      used to educate and inform people with text-based graphics on a platform that
      is focused on sharing images rather than text. With the increase in Black
      Lives Matter protests after the murder of George Floyd in March 2020,
      graphic design has become a powerful tool to share information about police
      brutality and racial discrimination, increasing public support of the
      movement. The informative Instagram slideshows that exploded over social
      media have been branded as “PowerPoint activism” (<a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/21359098/social-justice-slideshows-instagram-activism">
      "How social justice slideshows took over Instagram"</a>). They are
      characterized by “wide chunky typefaces and bold gradient graphics”
      (<a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/21359098/social-justice-slideshows-instagram-activism">
      "How social justice slideshows took over Instagram"</a>). Their simplicity
      engages readers, pausing a user’s scroll and causing them to read the text.
      There is a sort-of familiarity to the designs that are reminiscent of
      brand marketing that makes the information approachable and shareable. This
      is reflected in the “corporatization of progressive politics”
      (<a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/21359098/social-justice-slideshows-instagram-activism">
      "How social justice slideshows took over Instagram"</a>). The creator of
      the famous Instagram account @so.informed was inspired by the “inspirational
      graphics popular among millennial women” (<a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/21359098/social-justice-slideshows-instagram-activism">
      "How social justice slideshows took over Instagram"</a>) in hopes of
      appealing to the apolitical members of society. This aestheticization has
      come under fire, though, for its potential of long-term trivialization of
      pressing issues in society. Furthermore, the graphics’ failure to accurately
      capture the complexity of issues has a strong potential for misinformation.
