      <h2>Visual Activism - Corporate Efforts to Do Good</h2>

      <p>As the political climate changes, more people turn to social media to
      advocate for social change. Some corporations have seen the change in
      climate and have used their social media for good. However, are the
      intentions to push for social change, or to gain profit? You will be
      presented with examples of visual activism within a corporate setting and
      reasons why corporations do this in the first place.</p>

      <h3>What Is Corporate Activism?</h3>
      <p>Corporations are defined as a legal entity that's separate from their
      owners. Corporations can make a profit, be taxed, and can be held legally
      liable. [<a
      href="https://www.sba.gov/business-guide/launch-your-business/choose-business-structure">U.S. Small Business Administration</a>]</p>

      <p>Activism is defined as the effort to inform or convince groups to
      advocate for the change of a usually perceived corrupt system or
      institution. It means pushing for social good in a social, economic,
      environmental, or political sphere.</p>

      <p>Corporations have increasingly begun to perform actions unrelated to
      their businesses. American politics have a great presence on the internet,
      and due to this, corporations have taken a position on controversial
      issues. This is a new concept to the world of business, however, as it was
      not traditionally expected for corporations to publicly support or condemn
      political opinions.</p>

      <h3>What Does Visual Activism Look Like in A Corporate Setting?</h3>

      <p>“Data visualization is concise, understandable, and self-explanatory.
      It uses a careful choice of color scheme to enhance style and appeal. When
      in use, it must grab the attention of users.”* There is a simplicity to
      the visuals that make little room for confusion, in order to effectively
      inform an audience.</p>

      <p>Visual infographics normally look like a color scheme, contrasting or
      complementing colors with minimal text and little to no graphics. Using
      attention-grabbing headlines/hashtags, an infographic on social media will
      garner interactions through likes, comments, or shares, and therefore be
      successful in the algorithm.</p>

      <p>Similarly, marketed advertisements on the internet are simple,
      impactful, and persuasive. They exist to quickly garner attention,
      interaction, and customers.</p>

      <p>Infographics on the web are typically used as ways to concisely explain
      information or convince a user.</p>

      <p>Corporations have marketed their products in similar fashions, as
      discussed previously, but when activism meets the internet, what do
      corporations do to get involved?</p>

      <p>During the height of the Black Lives Matter movement in mid-2020,
      social media accounts made trends out of the hashtag #BLM, #GeorgeFloyd,
      and #SayHisName. Images like the ones used by Nike, Uber, and Ben &
      Jerry’s were posted, and companies came forward with their stances on the
      movement through tweets, Insta captions, and profile bios. The commonality
      was simplicity. A solid black background, a minimum character limit, a
      promise for corporate involvement—these were consistent in both the social
      media accounts and in the posts themselves.</p>

      <p>This commonality is no coincidence—there is a reason corporations use
      this as a cordant source of response. However, the answer to their
      reasoning is difficult to pinpoint when there are many reasons corporations
      have indoctrinated this form of activism.</p>

      <h3>Why Do Corporations Do This</h3>

      <p>The long-standing speculation over corporate responsibility has arrived
      to many conclusions. Some believe corporations benefit from activism and
      the good public image it brings is motivation to involvement. Others
      believe it is out of pure altruism, to spread information necessary in
      today’s society and to do the right thing.</p>

      <p>One study in the International Journal of Academic Research in Business
      and Social Sciences in 2016 found that consumers tend to engage more when
      a company is involved in corporate activism. [<a

      Perception of Corporate Activism: Strategic Implication for Marketing</a>]
      </p>

      <p>However, one thing is for certain. The rise of corporate activism and
      its continued strategy through visual activism has a solid correlation—the
      rise of the internet.</p>
