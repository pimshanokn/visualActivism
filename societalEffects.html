          Due to the public sphere nature of social media, it creates participation
          opportunities. Any user can not only share, but also create the content.
          In this digital age where the internet is widely accessible, people have come
          to use social media as a resource for news more and more. For social movements,
          social media makes activism more accessible. Anyone can post or share on any
          issues or events they want if they have some followers

          One of the ways to spread information that has been popular in recent years
          is infographics. It is a really effective tool to break down complex information
          into bitesize information. Infographics highlight how one can directly contribute
          with thissuese issue such as protest, donate, etc. Moreover, it shines the
          spotlight on issues and movements that are not traditionally covered by Western
          media like the End SARS movement in Nigeria <a href=https://cherwell.org/2021/04/12/everything-wrong-with-social-media-infographics-an-informative-thread/>
            (Everything wrong with social media infographics: an informative thread)</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the problems come in when this bitesize information is too bitesize.
          To fit into several picture frames, complex issues are simplified, generalized,
          and condensed.

          <img src="images/endSARS.jpg" alt="a graphic with the title #endSARS and the
          Nigerian flag in the background and a green power fist image in the corner. It
          reads
          What is #endSARS movement? The #endSARS movement is the fight against
          police brutality in Nigeria where police officers are misusing and abusing
          their power against Nigerian youths who have more luxurious items to them. The
          SARS unit has been accused of targeting young people who appear well-dressed,
          shaking them down for money, and torturing and abusing and even killing those
          who resist. Amnesty International says it documented more than 82 cases of
          abuse and extrajudicial killings by SARS officers from January 2017 to this May.
          What happened in Lekki and Alausa on October 20th? Several videos circulated
          on social media that showed crowds gathering at the Lekki toll gate in one of
          the suburbs of Lagos, where #endSARS protestors have been camped for two weeks.
          Uniformed men opened fire, and soldier were seen barricading the protest site
          beforehand, and Amnesty International received reports that shortly before the
          shootings, CCTV cameras were removed by government officials and the electricity
          was cut in an attempt to hide evidence. According to Amnesty International, at
          least 56 people have died across the country since the protests began, with
          about 38 killed on Tuesday alone. Eyewitnesses at a separate protest site in
          Alausa told Amnesty International that they were attacked by a team of soldiers
          and policemen from the Rapid Response Squad (RRS) Unit at about 8 p.m., leaving
          at least two people dead and one critically injured.
          How has National leadership responded? On October 11th, the Inspector General
          of Mohammed Adamu announced SARS would be disbanded (though this has been
          announced multiple times in the past), but that officers would be redeployed
          to other units. It's also been reported that another unit has been organized
          to replace SARS. This has led to another hashtag, #EndSwat, referring to the
          new Special Weapons and Tactics team. CNN reports that the International
          Committee of the Red Cross will help train SWAT and former SARS officers are
          not eligible to join. The government has also extended curfews outside of Laos
          to areas around Nigeria.
          What can we do to help? Stay informed on what's happening in Nigera and share
          about #endSARS on your own social media channels to increase awareness and
          spread the word. Donate to Feminist Coalition, formed by a group of young
          Nigerian feminists with a mission to champion equality for women in Nigerian
          society. The Coalition has been supporting protests and offers other ways to
          get involved on its site. Donate to Connected Development, an organization
          that empowers marginalized groups in Africa, supports grassroots efforts to
          improve public services, and has called for accountability for SARS officers
          engaged in violence/discrimination. Join a local protest in solidarity with
          those in Nigeria and all those who face brutality at the hands of police.

          In a way, infographics on social media give rise to slacktivism. It's easy-to-access
          nature of the platform can be harmful when it comes to the matter of activism
          too. Slacktivism is defined as “low-risk, low-cost activity via social media
          whose purpose is to raise awareness, produce change, or grant satisfaction
          to the person engaged in the activity” <a href=https://doi.org/10.1145/2470654.2470770>
          (Does Slacktivism Hurt Activism?: The Effects of Moral Balancing and Consistency
          in Online Activism)</a> or “the self-deluded idea that by liking, sharing,
          or producing something you are helping out but creates no tangible impact or change”
          <a href=https://cherwell.org/2021/04/12/everything-wrong-with-social-media-infographics-an-informative-thread/>
          (Everything wrong with social media infographics: an informative thread)</a>.

      </div>

      <div class="individual-box"> <!-- third slacktivism box -->
        <p>
          Examples of slacktivism are sharing
          infographics, signing online petitions, and posting just hashtag related to
          the movement without acknowledging the whole context.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another problem with slacktivism is that it stops people from taking another
          further step, taking their social media action into real life. This is because
          they thought their online action was already sufficient, when in fact it may
          not be as effective as offline actions <a href=https://whitmanwire.com/opinion/2021/09/16/infographics-desensitize-us-from-the-issues-at-hand/>

          <strong>Black Lives Matter Situation Example:</strong> <br>
          Instead of initiating serious discussion with people around one’s self to
          help raise the awareness and understanding of the issue, all the action is
          boiled down to sharing black square picture with a caption “#BlackOutTuesday”
          <a href=https://cherwell.org/2021/04/12/everything-wrong-with-social-media-infographics-an-informative-thread/>
          (Everything wrong with social media infographics: an informative thread)</a>.
          It may be true that this campaign gained public attention, but how many people
          who shared these posts actually have an in-depth understanding related to this issue?

      <div class=individual-box> <!-- fifth slacktivism box -->
        <p>
          This leads to another issue: “performative activism.” People sometimes feel
          pressured to reshare content related to social activism to demonstrate their
          allyship, but did not actually take any action to “truly” support the movement.

    <div class="grid-container">
      <div class=individual-box> <!-- first oversimplification box -->
        <p>
          According to a research done by Jonathan M. Cox about Black Lives Matter Movement
          <a href=https://doi.org/10.1080/01419870.2017.1334935>(The source of a
          movement: making the case for social media as an informational source
          using Black Lives Matter)</a>, it was found that two thirds of the students
          got information about the movement mainly from social media or, more specifically,
          infographics circulating on social media.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class=individual-box> <!-- second oversimplification box -->
        <p>
          Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement was originated in response to “the shooting
          death of Trayvon Martin in 2012, after which his killer, George Zimmerman,
          a civilian, was acquitted, and Trayvon was “post-humously placed on trial
          for his own murder.” Apart from that, the movement was established with the
          purpose to give voice to black individuals who are women, queer, transgender,
          disabled, and undocumented.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class=individual-box> <!-- third oversimplification box -->
        <p>
          BLM movement was also initiated by the queer black women. However, only three
          students out of 35 mentioned this fact when interviewed about it during the
          experiment. Most students also mainly associate BLM with police brutality,
          putting other issues BLM advocate for in the blur. Only five students mention
          other issues that BLM advocates for apart from violence against blacks. This
          demonstrates a limited scope of information they have received and comprehended
          mainly from social media. Information presented on these online platforms may be
          facts. However, to what extent are these facts accurate and representative
          of all the aspects of a social movement?

            Nowadays, we talk and advocate more about social issues openly on social media.
            It is good that people give more attention to these problems. However, it may
            have reached the point where these issues are not taken seriously.
          </p>
          <p>
            Infographics usually have similar patterns: eye-catching fonts, bubbly background
            color, and cute pictures. It is common to see a bold headline about the topic
            they are advocating for like “Defund the Police” or “Abortion is Healthcare.”
            However, no further detailed explanation is provided. This trivializes or
            “sugar coates” delicate serious topics like racism or sexism

            Not only do these infographics not accomplish its purpose of providing information
            about the issue or movement, it also desensitizes the social media users who
            are constantly seeing these infographics on their social media. It is great
            that talking about social issues can be a part of daily life, but its importance
            may be reduced once embedded in between other general Instagram stories.

          Since it is so easy to make and distribute infographics, it is very common to
          see multiple infographics about countless issues circulating around social media.
          As social media users are constantly exposed to this depressing content, lack
          of motivation to consistently keep up with issues around the world, or activism
          fatigue, may occur <a href=https://cherwell.org/2021/04/12/everything-wrong-with-social-media-infographics-an-informative-thread/>

          When exposed to a lot of information per day, it is impossible for human’s
          brain to retain or have a focus on every issue. Are we just hopping on from
          one issue to another “trending” one?

          Since it is accessible for anyone to make and share infographics, it is possible
          too that misinformation can become viral. News on social media changes and spreads
          quickly. The scary thing is that it is not directly linked to any specific person
          or organization who will be responsible to correct the error in information
          provided. Nowadays, the quicker the information is updated, the more it is perceived
          to be more credible. The social media algorithm plays a part in presenting incomplete
          and skewed to the user's beliefs too.

    <!-- Moral Balancing Section -->
    <h3 class="headings">Moral Balancing</h3>
    <div class="grid-container">
      <div class="individual-box"> <!-- first moral balancing box -->
        <p>
          The experiment conducted by Yu-Hao Lee and Gary Hsieh at Michigan State University
          investigated the question of <a href=https://doi.org/10.1145/2470654.2470770>
          “Does Slacktivism Hurt Activism?: The Effects of Moral Balancing and Consistency
          in Online Activism.”</a> It explored how the decision of partaking in
          low-cost, low-risk online activism may affect subsequent civic action.
          The experiment was based around the event of the Aurora Colorado shooting
          in July 2012. Participants were invited to sign an online petition
          (considered as slacktivism as it does not have any tangible effect) to ban
          assault rifles. Then, they were asked to donate to either the gun control
          organization or the education organization.

      </div>

      <div class="individual-box">  <!-- third moral balancing box -->
        <p>
          The results showed that participants
          who did not sign an online petition tended to donate more to the gun control
          organization. In contrast, participants who signed an online petition donated
          less to the gun control organization and more to the education organization.
        </p>
        <p>
          This experiment shows the moral balancing effect. Participants who signed
          an online petition to ban assault rifles felt like they have already contributed
          something positive to the gun control issue. Therefore, they decided to do
          something good for other issues too to help out every problem as equally as
          possible. However, participants fail to realize that signing online petitions
          creates far less impact than donating money. In the end, it can be said that
          slacktivism can possibly hurt real activism like protests, community volunteerism,
          and charity.
