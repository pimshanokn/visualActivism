### Home Page
The website's homepage is designed to mock Instragram layout, since it is the platform that infographics circulate widely. The profile icon on the top right is clickable, displaying a drop-down menu for users to navigate to other pages on the website. Individual page can also be accessed through clicking on the "post." </br>
